    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Mulukhiyah, also known as molokhia, molohiya, or ewedu, is a dish made from the leaves of Corchorus olitorius, commonly known in English as denje'c'jute, nalta jute, tossa jute. It is used as a vegetable and is mainly eaten in the Levant, Egypt, Sudan, Cyprus, Libya, Tunisia and Algeria.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Cooking liquid</li>
        <li>Frozen Molokhia</li>
        <li>Dry coriander</li>
        <li>Garlic</li>
        <li>Ghee</li>
        <li>Bullion cube</li>
        <li>Tomato sauce</li>
        <li>Baking soda</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a deep pot over medium-high heat melt ghee.</li>
        <li>Saut√© garlic for 15-30 seconds.</li>
        <li>Until lightly golden and fragrant as shown in picture.</li>
        <li>Add coriander and keep stirring for another 30 seconds.</li>
        <li>The coriander will give its fragrance and turn a little more dark brown.</li>
        <li>Pour in some of the broth keeping the rest after we check consistency at the end.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle the bouillon cube. Stir until it is dissolved.</li>
        <li>Add the baking soda if you chose to, notice that the broth will foam.</li>
        <li>Add the Molokhia, and turn down the heat to medium low, keep stirring every now and then.</li>
        <li>Molokhia will slowly melt in the broth. Wait until it has completely melted.</li>
        <li>Pour in the tomato sauce and stir well.</li>
        <li>
            Check consistency: if it is too thick for your liking add more broth.
        </li>
        <li>
            Check the seasoning and sweetness: if you need salt or more tomato sauce.
        </li>
        <li>Serve with rice and pita bread.</li>
        </ol>
